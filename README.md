# codedamn-problem-1 (CSS Shapes Lab)

In this lab exercise, you will learn how to create a Sqaure and a Circle using CSS.

Steps
1. Creating a Square:
Add a new element in your index.html file with an id 'square'
In your CSS file, set the width and height properties for this id to be equal. For instance, use 100px for a square of dimensions 100x100px
2. Creating a Circle:
Create a new div element in your index.html file with an id 'circle'
Set the width and height of the #circle to 100px
Set the border-radius property to 50% to create a circle
3. Add Background Colors
The created elements are not visible to you unless you've given them a background color. You have to add a background color to both #circle and #square elements. You can add your favourite colors as the background color.

By default the background-color of the elements is transparent, therefore not visible to us
